# EthProof Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract implements a simple token standard with functionalities for minting and burning tokens.

## Requirements

1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbreviation, Total Supply)
2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the “sender” address by that amount
4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the “sender”.
5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of the "sender" is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

## Usage

### Deployment

You can deploy this contract on a compatible Ethereum network using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Make sure to select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (>=0.8.9).

### Interacting with the Contract

After deployment, you can interact with the contract through its functions:

- `mint(address _address, uint _value)`: Mints `_value` tokens and assigns them to `_address`.
- `burn(address _address, uint _value)`: Burns `_value` tokens from `_address`.

## Development

This contract was developed in Solidity version 0.8.9. You can find the source code in the `EthAssessment.sol` file.
